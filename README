librpi_imu
         configures the inertial sensors via i2c
         making the data available via library calls.
         various automatic calibration algorithms as well as sensor fusion
         (gradient decent) are performed.

        ~/.rpi_autopilot/imu_config
        configures the imu and stores calibration coefficients for sensors
        as well as alignment to vessel.

librpi_servo
        driving servos (position mode) or electric speed controllers (speed mode) with
        current feedback to detect stalling and stops.

        ~/.rpi_autopilot/servo_config

        Servos can be connected either via usb (arduino) or eventually
        via spi (with avr as spi slave)

        capabilities are determined via servo protocol, and include:

        number of pwm outputs
        current/voltage sense
        etc..
